## Frameworks

1. [MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) - Lightweight, Portable, Flexible Distributed/Mobile Deep Learning with Dynamic, Mutation-aware Dataflow Dep Scheduler; for Python, R, Julia, Go, Javascript and more.
2. [go-mxnet-predictor](https://github.com/songtianyi/go-mxnet-predictor) - Go binding for MXNet c_predict_api to do inference with pre-trained model.
3. [deeplearning4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j) - Distributed Deep Learning Platform for Java, Clojure, Scala.
4. [Distributed Machine learning Tool Kit (DMTK)](http://www.dmtk.io/) - A distributed machine learning (parameter server) framework by Microsoft. Enables training models on large data sets across multiple machines. Current tools bundled with it include: LightLDA and Distributed (Multisense) Word Embedding.
5. [Elephas](https://github.com/maxpumperla/elephas) - Elephas is an extension of Keras, which allows you to run distributed deep learning models at scale with Spark.
6. [Horovod](https://github.com/uber/horovod) - Distributed training framework for TensorFlow.
